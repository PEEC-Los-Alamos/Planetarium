Nightshade Notes

Compiled by Akkana, Galen, Patricia and other planetarium volunteers.

========= AT THE PLANETARIUM ============================

TO PREPARE A USB STICK FOR THE PLANETARIUM:

Scripts have to be in a folder named "scripts" on the USB stick
for nightshade to see them.

If you have images, put them in a subdirectory "images" inside the
"scripts" folder. Likewise sky cultures.

The web control panel has run, stop, pause buttons, which is handy
because you can see whether your script is running or paused (which
you can't tell when you're testing a script at home);
but be VERY CAREFUL of the STOP button, because once you've stopped
a script, it's stopped, and all you can do is restart from the beginning.

========= SCRIPTING NOTES ===============

The sky in the planetarium by default is rotated so people are looking
at the southern sky. If you want to show something in the northern
sky, like Polaris, this helps:
  set heading 180 duration 4
  wait duration 4

auto_move_duration seems to be how long it takes nightshade
to move to center an object while zooming it.
If it's 0, the view will jump instantly to center the object
before zooming.
If it's set to the same as or longer than the zoom duration,
then nightshade will zoom to a random patch of sky
and then later will pan, still zoomed way in, over to the object.
So be sure this is always set to substantially LESS than the zoom time.
Be sure to set it at the beginning of your script.
The default value may be okay on any given computer
but then may turn out to be much longer in the planetarium.

========= NIGHTSHADE ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER ===============

TO RUN A SCRIPT:
    m for menu
    uparrow a few times to get to scripts
    rightarrow
    downarrow to choose a script
    m

Key bindings while running a script:
    6 To pause/unpause a script
    7 or Ctrl-C to end a script
    K to resume
    L Fast-forward (speed up script)
    J Slow script down

There's no way to tell for sure when your script is running vs. paused,

Looking back at earth, the moon, etc.

LOOKING DOWN ON A PLANET:
The user guide says:

    "At very high altitudes you can look down on your home planet"

but it doesn't give any hints how to do that, and I (Akkana) can't
seem to get this to work no matter what I try. If I set the moon to be
the home planet, then selecting the moon doesn't work and seems to
confuse nightshade's idea of where it is, to the point where I usually
have to restart to get things right again.

Testing external_viewer:
If you want to play videos at home, you can test it by creating an
executable script in Nightshade's installed data directory, e.g.
/usr/local/share/nightshade/data/script_external_viewer,
containing something like this:

#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "start" ]; then mplayer -fs -osdlevel 0 $2 ; fi
if [ "$1" = "stop" ]; then killall mplayer ; fi

See this thread:
https://answers.launchpad.net/nightshade/+question/101610

That will play fullscreen, but you won't be able to test the size
or position of your videos.

=========== SELECTING NEBULAE ===========

Nightshade has a fixed list of names it knows how to select.
Unfortunately, you can't just select any M or NGC object.
It can't even select M42 or M57!
You have to use the name from their undocumented list of names.
I think the list is the same one that's in src/translations.h,
and the same as the names that autocomplete if you do a search in
nightshade's search box: so try searching for your nebula interactively,
find out what it autocompletes to, and use that as the string you
select in your script. For example:
select nebula "M27"
select nebula "Ring Nebula"
select nebula "M42/M43"

Why the Ring is referred to only by name but the Dumbbell and the Pleiades
only by number is a mystery for the ages. And maybe it'll all be different in
Nightshade-NG.

How do you find out? I think it's using the list in src/translations.h
(search for "Nebulae"). Which is in a completely random order.

=========== RUNNING SCRIPTS FROM A LOCAL FOLDER ===========

Nightshade when it's running on your home machine has no provision to
run scripts from a local directory, e.g. your home directory.
The most straightforward solution is to copy them into the system
directory under /opt or /usr/local, wherever Nightshade is installed.

If you use asterisms, images or other media in your scripts, you don't
have to all of them separately: you can link from Nightshade's system
data/scripts directory to your images or asterisms directory, then
Nightshade will be able to use all the files there.

But from main.cpp: it looks like ./data/ssystem.ini exists and is
readable under the current directory, then Nightshade will look for
scripts (and other data) in ./data/scripts; otherwise it uses
/usr/local/share/nightshade/data/scripts/ (or equivalent in /opt). So
in theory, if you want it to look in a local directory, make sure there's
a ./data/scripts under the current directory when you start nightshade.
Note: in that case it will ONLY find scripts there, and won't look for
system-installed scripts.

=========== USING A NEW SKY CULTURE, E.G. asterisms ===========

Make a new directory inside "scripts" on your USB stick
named "asterisms", then in your script you can do:

sky_culture action load path asterisms

and then you can highlight asterisms like:

select constellation BDi

(for the Big Dipper).

=========== CHANGING/ADDING CONSTELLATION/ASTERISM LINES ===========

The numbers in constellationship.fab in each sky_cultures directory
are Hipparchus (I think) star numbers. I got this from the source
code (constellation.cpp). So for example, if you look in
star_names.fab you'll see 91262|Vega, and 91262 is one of the
numbers in the Lyr line in constellationship.fab:

Lyr 5  91262 91971 91971 92420 92420 93194 93194 92791 92791 91971

The first number is the number of line segments; then each pair of
numbers represents one line segment.

If you click on a star in Nightshade it will give you the Hipparchos
number, so you're not limited to named stars.

So, for example, suppose I want to change Lyra's boundaries so that
in addition to the single tail going out to Vega, I want a second
tail going out to epsilon Lyrae. I click on the star where the tail
starts, and find out that's 91971. Then I click on epsilon, and it's
91926. (That's actually epsilon Lyr 2, but either one is close
enough for the purpose of constellation lines.)

So that means I want a new line going from 91971 to 91926.
So I edit /data/sky_cultures/western/constellationship.fab and
change that Lyr line to:

Lyr 6  91262 91971 91971 92420 92420 93194 93194 92791 92791 91971 91971 91926

The only trick is that western turned out not to be the default sky
culture for me; I think western-color is, but I'm not sure,
nightshade isn't telling me. But if I go to the Language tab in
Configuration I can switch to Western and then I see my new
constellation line.

============ Questions we still have about Nightshade =============

1) how to input specific radiants for meteor showers?
2) how to keep all constellation lines from showing up when you have selected
and shown a particular one and then you select an object that does not lie on
the (previously) selected constellation's lines?
3) is it possible to backspace a script in progress without starting over, or
to start a script midway through?
4) can we get the Large Magellanic Cloud labelled?
5) can we set magnitude limits for the labelling of solar system objects so
that the distant dwarf planets don't appear?
6) how about subroutines or control structures (loops) within scripts?

============ wishlist =============

Nightshade wishlist:

- Subroutines in scripts (if/then and loops would be great too)
- More predictable moves and zooms.
  E.g. a selected object should always stay centered during a zoom
  regardless of how long the zoom takes, not pan to unpredictable places
  and make the audience barf. :-)
- Time control in scripts: start from / run to a specific time, instead
  of needing to convert start time - end time to seconds, divide by
  the current timerate and re-do that every time a delay is changed.
- Consistency (or at least documentation) on how to show one constellation,
  vs. several, vs. all, with or without bodies or nebulae being shown,
  both in scripts and live. ("Select" does lots of different things,
  and it's easy to do something like deselect a planet and have all the
  constellation lines suddenly appear.)
- In live UI (console): shortcuts to show common groups of constellations,
  e.g. zodiacal constellations or galactic center constellations.
- A way to highlight certain constellations, orbits etc. by color,
  e.g. show all constellations but make the zodiacal ones red
  instead of yellow -- both live and in scripts.
- A way to turn off objects like Haumea and Makemake
- Turn on planet names by groups, e.g. show only naked-eye planets,
  turn on outer planets, include dwarf planets like Makemake.
  (Pluto should be grouped with outer planets like Neptune,
  not only with Haumea and Makemake.)
- A way to look down on the a body -- the doc says it's possible
  but doesn't say how. Also, a way to be above the solar system
  looking down on planetary orbits. (Looks like this is already in NG.)
- Meteor showers, with radiant (comets would be nice too)
- Consistent nebula selection: have ALL M numbers (e.g. M42, M57)
  and also some aliases for names like Ring nebula.
- ALL Messier objects available as individual object, including M43
  and M55, and other important objects like the LMC.
- Better control over running scripts, e.g. start at a specific point,
  step back and try something again.
- More stars: at least as many as in old Nightshade, including double
  stars like Sirius B, Epsilon Lyrae double-double.
- Longitude of GRS: the home version of Nightshade (non-NG) has the
  GRS at a different place from the planetarium version. I haven't
  verified which one is right, but we need a way to make sure they're
  the same so we can preview shows while writing them, and it would
  be good to have a way to update the longitude since it changes.
- A way of running "universal console" at home, so we can practice with
  the interface at home without needing to schedule planetarium time
  and drive to the planetarium.
- A version that we can compile/run on our home computers!
  (All three platforms.) On Linux, NightshadeNG currently doesn't
  compile (syntax errors); on Mac, haven't gotten past the dependencies
  yet. I don't think anyone here has tried on Windows.

Wishlist for playing media:
- a progress bar with an indication of time/length
- pause, fast-forward and rewind
- show lengths of videos in the menu: currently the only way to find
  out is to play all the way to the end and time with a stopwatch.
